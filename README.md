# wave collapse sudoku
Uses the wave function collapse algorithm to solve sudoku.

Main program is in sudoku.py, use -b to benchmark the solver, -s to watch the solver, -c for a custom board (accepts 81 chars ./0 to represent unknowns).

SLOWLY working towards a reimplementation in C and a HTML visualizer. Will probably take forever to finish.
